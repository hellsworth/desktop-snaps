 PURPOSE:
       Check that snapd-desktop-integration works properly
 BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE AND SETUP:
       The daemon to be tested is at io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration, and what has to be tested is the io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration interface of the /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration object.
       The four methods of the SnapDesktopIntegration object are:
           - ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed(string application_name, String lock_file, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshCompleted(string application_name, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshPercentage(string application_name, String bar_text, Double percentage, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
           - ApplicationRefreshPulse(string application_name, String bar_text, Dict of {String, Variant} extra_parameters)
       These functions will be tested in a program called d-feet. Here is how to get setup for testing these functions in d-feet:
           1. Install it with `sudo apt install d-feet`
           2. Run the application
           3. With d-feet you can search in either "System Bus" or "Session Bus". For testing snapd-desktop-integration, we want to search in "Session Bus" so click that.
           4. In the search bar, type "desktopintegration" and it will find one object, io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration
           5. Once you select io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration in the left panel, you can expand the /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration object to find the four methods to test. See https://github.com/ubuntu/desktop-snaps/blob/stable/checkbox-test-plans/unit-assets/snapd-desktop-integration_d-feet.png. The object path is: /io/snapcraft/SnapDesktopIntegration -> Interfaces -> io.snapcraft.SnapDesktopIntegration -> Methods to find the four methods to test.
           6. Proceed with the four test cases below.

 TEST CASE 1:
      1. Create a non-empty temporal text file (let’s say: /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock; it must be in a place reachable by SnapdDesktopIntegration):
         $ sudo cat /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock
         30
      2. In d-feet, double click on ApplicationIsBeingRefreshed in the right panel, to open the "Execute D-Bus Method" window   
      3. Put this in the "Method Input" box:
         "app1","/var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock",{"wait_change_in_lock_file": GLib.Variant("b", True)}
      4. Click on "Execute"
      5. You should see a progress window appear saying that “app1” is being refreshed, and with a pulsed progress bar moving left-to-right and vice-versa.
      6. With the progress window open, go delete the /var/lib/snapd/inhibit/test.lock file in a terminal and the progress window should go away.
